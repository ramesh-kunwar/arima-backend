# üö® CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

## The Real Performance Story

### ‚ùå **What's Wrong:**
1. **R¬≤ = -0.015 to -0.265**: Models are worse than predicting the simple average
2. **Directional Accuracy < 50%**: Trend prediction worse than coin flip
3. **Overall Grade: D**: Poor model performance despite acceptable MAPE

### ‚úÖ **What's Acceptable:**
- **MAPE 16-19%**: Within business forecasting range (usually <20% is good)
- **MAE values**: Reasonable daily error margins

## üéØ **Key Metrics You Should Monitor:**

### **Primary Metrics (Most Important):**
1. **MAPE**: < 20% (‚úÖ GOOD)
2. **R¬≤**: > 0.3 (‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE)
3. **Directional Accuracy**: > 50% (‚ùå MAJOR PROBLEM)

### **Secondary Metrics:**
4. **MAE**: Absolute error in business units
5. **RMSE**: Penalty for large prediction errors

## üö® **Root Cause Analysis:**

### **Why R¬≤ is Negative:**
- Model predictions have higher variance than actual data
- ARIMA isn't capturing the true patterns in pizza sales
- Data may have complex patterns ARIMA can't handle

### **Why Directional Accuracy is Poor:**
- Pizza sales may have non-linear patterns
- Seasonal/cyclical patterns not captured by simple ARIMA
- External factors (promotions, weather) affecting sales

## üí° **Immediate Actions Needed:**

### **1. Data Investigation (Priority 1):**
```
- Check for weekly seasonality (Mon-Sun patterns)
- Look for monthly/seasonal trends
- Identify outliers and special events
- Analyze weekend vs weekday patterns
```

### **2. Model Improvements (Priority 2):**
```
- Try SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
- Consider Prophet (Facebook's forecasting tool)
- Test ensemble methods
- Add external variables (holidays, promotions)
```

### **3. Alternative Approaches (Priority 3):**
```
- Machine Learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Deep Learning (LSTM networks)
- Hybrid approaches
```

## üìä **Performance Thresholds:**

| Metric | Excellent | Good | Acceptable | Poor |
|--------|-----------|------|------------|------|
| MAPE | <10% | 10-20% | 20-30% | >30% |
| R¬≤ | >0.7 | 0.5-0.7 | 0.3-0.5 | <0.3 |
| Dir. Acc | >70% | 60-70% | 50-60% | <50% |

**Current Status: POOR** (despite acceptable MAPE)

## üéØ **Business Decision Framework:**

### **For Operations (Short-term):**
- Use **Quantity model** (best MAPE: 16.2%)
- Apply **¬±30% safety margins** due to poor R¬≤
- **Manual adjustments** for known events

### **For Strategic Planning:**
- **DO NOT rely** on these models for critical decisions
- **Improve models first** before strategic use
- Consider **simple moving averages** as baseline

## üîß **Quick Wins to Try:**

1. **Weekly Aggregation**: Sum to weekly totals, may improve patterns
2. **Moving Averages**: Simple 7-day moving average baseline
3. **Trend Decomposition**: Separate trend, seasonal, and residual components
4. **Log Transformation**: May stabilize variance for better R¬≤
